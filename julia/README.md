# Julia Projects

In this directory, you will find a collection of Julia examples and their respective tests

## Testing

You can either run `julia tests/RunTests.jl` to run every defined test, or you can
run each test individually with `julia tests/test_name.test`

## Notes

I went with .test as the extension as some CI suites I am trying out don't like the `.jl` extension
and I have not looked into workarounds. Call this laziness.

I have borrowed code in here, and while I made an attempt to build off the examples I found, there are some that are still quite true to original.
